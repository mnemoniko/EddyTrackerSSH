# EddyTrackerSSH
This Matlab code uses Sea Surface Height (SSH) to identify and track eddies.  Originally written for use with satellite altimetry data, this version is adapted to use model output in x-y coordinates, instead of latitutde-longitude.

This code originated from https://github.com/jfaghm/OceanEddies, and was modified by Gaube & McGillicuddy [2017].  This version appears in Mack et al [2018].
